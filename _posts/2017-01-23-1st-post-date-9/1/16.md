In our first lesson we did remade our blogs and got started doing yr 8 IT with mr ambah khorsa, We hadnt had a it lesson for a whole term since yr 7 with mr keen,We were late for the lesson as we went to the wrong classroom.I am very excited about using the fuse boxes next week.i must remember to take my USB(or pen drive) for next lesson so i can save my fuse box work.
