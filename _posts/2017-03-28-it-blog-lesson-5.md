    <td>I worked in a pair this lesson, and i was new to the experience, however it was a very productive lesson, there was one person reading out and one typing, which worked very well,we  would swap over every 20 mins so it was fair.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I am a slow typer  and i also read out wrong, or said something confusing, which was not good. If i work in a pair again, i will be more careful. I was less effecient than a two because we ha to keep speaking, and then writing, in a one you just write.in a 3 there is someone to spot mistakes, in a two, there isnt anyone there</td>

    <td>There is not much you can do about the slowness issue, i will try to work  in a three or a two next time, but i will try to work better if i must go in a two</td>
