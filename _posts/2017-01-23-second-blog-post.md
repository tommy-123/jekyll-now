This week we started using fuse boxes and did some coding.We used a manual to help us iand I think I made good progress. I manage to put the hello world text upon the screen, in diffrent colours and the writting moved slowly, accross the page,so that was successful.However i came across a problem with my work, when i pluged my usb(pen drive) into my fuse box, the mouse stoped working and i couldnt save it onto the usb.i put marker on it so i can have the same fuse box next time, which has my work saved onto it.
