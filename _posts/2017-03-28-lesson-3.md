    <td>This was my first lesson working with the group, and i think it went well, we got a lot of work done and are one step closer to our aim of using the robotic arm! Hopefully it wil be the start of many productive lessons, we will have a rota to decide who will work on there own, as one person is always unused in a 3.</td>

    <td>It is hard being in a 3, as one unlucky person is not doing much work and therefore not learning, which is a shame, hopefully we will work out a system which works, or we will use the rota.</td>

    <td>We have the option of one person working on there own, or perhaps with someone else whos partner isnt there, i will read what the manual says and not just the code so i will learn more and not just be copying </td>
